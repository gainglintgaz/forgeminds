# The VIBE Standard v5.3 — 54 Mandatory Rules
These rules are absolute. Do not deviate.

## I. Execution & Discipline (1-6)
1. **Atomic Tasks:** ONE problem at a time. Max 1-2 file changes per iteration.
2. **Think Before Coding:** Explain plan, list affected files, identify risks FIRST.
3. **Self-Review:** After each change, critique edge cases, duplication, consistency.
4. **Verification Required:** List exactly what to test. Do not proceed until verified.
5. **Zero Silent Failures:** Fix all console errors, TS warnings, UI glitches immediately.
6. **Consistency Over Creativity:** Follow existing patterns. Never introduce new styles.

## II. UI & UX (7-11)
7. **No All-Caps/Italic Headers:** Title Case + font-semibold + tracking-tight only.
8. **Primary Color:** Use the project's design system tokens. No ad-hoc hex colors.
9. **Clean Spacing:** 8/16/24/32/40/48/64/80px increments. Card padding ~p-6.
10. **Simple UX:** App must feel self-explanatory. Add micro helper text where needed.
11. **Honest Strings:** Every metric, percentage, and label must reflect REAL data. No fake numbers.

## III. State & Data (12-14)
12. **State Persists:** Critical state uses Zustand persist + localStorage.
13. **Fresh Data:** Never rely on stale state. Fetch fresh data when needed.
14. **Money & Math:** ALWAYS stored as BIGINT cents in DB. / 100 for display. NEVER floating-point.

## IV. Architecture (15-22)
15. **Learning System:** Before building: check golden-paths + errors-fixed.json. After: update both.
16. **Reuse Before Build:** Search codebase first. Don't reinvent.
17. **Do Not Overbuild:** Simplest working solution first.
18. **Mode Safety (Identity Firewall):** Always confirm currentMode. Never mix data across modes. Clear ALL arrays on mode switch.
19. **Scope Lock:** Only work on CURRENT TASK from CURRENT_SPRINT.md.
20. **Fail Fast:** If something breaks, stop, find root cause, revert if needed.
21. **Rule Evolution:** After milestones, suggest rule updates.
22. **Compute Placement:** UI is for display. Heavy computations on backend (Edge Functions/RPCs).

## V. AI Boundaries (23-26)
23. **PII Scrubbing:** NEVER send raw SSNs, EINs, bank numbers, full names to any AI API. Truncate merchants to 20 chars.
24. **Invisible Ledger:** AI output NEVER written raw to DB. Always safeParseJson() + mapping layer.
25. **API Cost Sentinel:** Default to local computation. Rate-limit external AI calls.
26. **Golden Path First:** Prove the happy path works before coding edge cases.

## VI. Git Hygiene (27-33)
27. **Session Start:** Run `git worktree list` + `git branch -a` before any changes.
28. **Correct Branch:** Never start work without confirming you're on the right branch.
29. **Worktree Check:** If multiple worktrees exist, identify latest and merge/rebase first.
30. **Cleanup:** After merge, delete stale worktrees.
31. **Missing Feature Check:** Check other branches FIRST before reimplementing.
32. **Authoritative Branch:** `main` is canonical. All work rebases onto main.
33. **Never Commit Secrets:** .env files go in .env.local (git-ignored). Pre-commit hook blocks secrets.

## VII. Universal Rules (34-43)
34. **"Temporary" Doesn't Exist.** Every placeholder ships. Build it real or don't build it.
35. **Build Passing != Working.** "It compiles" is the LOWEST signal. Five gates required, in order, each blocks the next: (1) `npx tsc --noEmit` passes — catches what Vite/Turbopack skip; (2) `npm run lint` passes — no ESLint errors; (3) browser click-through with DevTools open — primary user flows render with zero console errors; (4) DB SELECT round-trip — for any feature that writes data, run a query confirming the row exists with correct columns; (5) column-drift grep — `.from("table").select("col")` strings audited against live `information_schema.columns`. Cannot mark a feature, phase, or sprint "done" with even one of these missing. Stringly-typed queries (Supabase, raw SQL, GraphQL templates) escape TypeScript entirely — only runtime + grep catches drift. ForgeMinds Phase 0 declared "done" three times with build passing but every Supabase query referencing wrong column names. See lessons.md #93. Mechanical enforcement: pre-commit hook rejects commits with `done|complete|finished|ship` keywords unless commit message body contains an `AUDIT GATE` block listing all five gates passing.
36. **Two Insert Paths = Double Audit.** Multiple write paths? Audit ALL on schema changes.
37. **23505 = Already Saved.** UNIQUE violation = skip silently. NEVER retry with new ID.
38. **Migrations Are STALE.** Always verify live DB schema via SQL audit before changes.
39. **System Boundary Bugs.** "Not found in code" != "doesn't exist." Bugs live at RLS, Edge Functions, env config.
40. **Context Drift = Death.** Persistent tracking files (CURRENT_SPRINT.md, V1_FEATURE_BACKLOG.md) are mandatory.
41. **Track Features Immediately.** Add to backlog as DISCUSSED the moment a feature is mentioned.
42. **Session Prompts Are Contracts.** Not suggestions. Follow them exactly.
43. **Dashboard Intelligence Early.** Must visibly show intelligence within first 3 items.

## VIII. Data Completeness & Smart Feature Gates (44-51)
44. **Data Completeness Gate:** Smart features (projections, tax reports, AI insights, advice, reconciliation) MUST NOT render with incomplete data. Show a locked state with a checklist of exactly what's missing. Incomplete > Inaccurate.
45. **Temporal Integrity:** Financial documents are stored and attributed to the tax year they cover, NOT the upload date. A 2025 W-2 uploaded in 2026 is a 2025 document. This must be enforced at the DB insert layer.
46. **Year Scope Label:** Every financial report, projection, and calculation must explicitly state the time period it covers on-screen. "Tax Center" is not a label. "2025 Federal Tax Return" and "2026 YTD Projection" are labels.
47. **Prerequisite Checklist:** Every smart feature defines its required inputs before it is built. These are rendered as a visible checklist to the user. The feature is locked until prerequisites are met. No silent degradation.
48. **Data Basis Disclosure:** Any calculation or projection must show what data it's based on. "Projection based on 1 of ~24 expected paystubs" is mandatory when extrapolating. Never let a partial calculation look like a complete one.
49. **Export Relevance:** Exports must match their stated context. Tax exports contain only tax-relevant items. Transactional exports are separate. Never mix them and never include irrelevant data in a contextual export.
50. **Probing Before Building (Money/Trust Features):** For any feature touching financial calculations, tax, AI advice, or user-trust decisions — Claude MUST ask at minimum: (1) what data is required, (2) what's the completeness gate, (3) what does the empty/incomplete state look like, (4) what time period does it cover, (5) what breaks downstream if one input is wrong. Do not write code until these are answered.
51. **No Dead UI:** Every button, link, and action visible to a user must work. A delete account button that does nothing is worse than no button. A tax projection button that routes to the dashboard destroys trust instantly. Wire it or remove it.

## IX. Code Quality & Backend Hygiene (52-54)
52. **No Silent Catch Blocks:** Every catch block must do one of three things: (a) re-throw the error, (b) log with context — what was being attempted + the error itself, or (c) render a user-visible error state. `catch(e) {}` is forbidden. `catch(e) { console.error('[featureName] failed:', e); throw e; }` is the minimum acceptable pattern.
53. **N+1 Prevention:** Never fetch a list then loop to fetch related items individually. Use a JOIN, a `.in()` query, or an RPC that returns everything in one round trip. Any data fetch inside a `.map()` or `.forEach()` is a mandatory review stop — it almost always means N+1. Flag it, fix it, or document why it's intentional.
54. **Schema-First for New Tables:** Before writing any INSERT or SELECT, define the full schema: primary key, foreign keys with explicit ON DELETE behavior, indexes on every column used in WHERE/ORDER BY/JOIN, and the DOWN migration. No table gets created without all four decided and written down first. Additionally: every table that accepts imports, uploads, or scans MUST include a `content_hash` or `import_hash` column with a UNIQUE constraint for dedup. Every table that stores AI-generated output MUST include `prompt_version` to trace which model/prompt produced the result.

## X. Multi-Tenant Configurability (55) — added 2026-04-30 (ForgeMinds Phase 1)

55. **Every UX-affecting value is per-user-configurable from day 1.** Hardcoded knobs in code are vendor opinions masquerading as truth. Anything a user might reasonably want different — schedule (when, how often, timezone, active hours/days), recency window, lookback period, density (target count, max per category, max per entity), filter thresholds (min score, excluded topics, tracked tickers), delivery channels (email/push/dashboard/webhook), voice (tone, formality, length) — gets a column in `user_preferences` (or equivalent settings table) with a sensible default, AND code that reads the preference with fallback. **NEVER bake a "system default" into a hardcoded literal — that's a config file in the wrong place.**

   **Cron / scheduling specifically:** never write one pg_cron job per user (doesn't scale past hundreds). Use the **dispatcher pattern**: ONE pg_cron job per pipeline step ticks every minute, queries `user_preferences` for users whose schedule matches NOW (in their timezone, within their active hours, on a cadence multiple), and dispatches per-user invocations. Routes accept `?user_id=...` query param OR an array body for batch. Dispatcher is in DB; routes are in code.

   **What this prevents:** declaring a project "multi-tenant" when the cron schedule is `'0,30 11-23 * * 1-5'` for everyone. Building a "single-user prototype" that requires a full Phase 2 refactor to onboard the second user. The moment you have real users, "I want a weekly digest at 8am Mondays in PT" should be a settings change, not a code change.

   **What this allows:** Phase 1 ships with sensible defaults (so Victor as test user works immediately) but EVERY default lives in `user_preferences` schema columns, not in JS constants. Phase 2's "add onboarding UI" becomes a trivial form over an existing schema, not a rewrite.

   See: ForgeMinds Phase 1 cron dispatcher (`supabase/migrations/20260501*_pg_cron_*.sql`), `user_preferences.{timezone, cadence_minutes, active_hours_start/end, recency_window_minutes, score_lookback_minutes, min_composite_score, max_articles_per_brief, max_per_category}`.

## XI. AI-Assisted Discovery (56) — added 2026-05-04 (ForgeMinds Phase 1.5)

56. **AI-Assisted Discovery Over User Configuration.** When a feature requires the user to know something esoteric (which RSS feed exists, which API to call, which library to use, which tool fits their stack, which threshold to pick, which integration to wire), the **default UI is a conversational AI agent** that helps them figure it out — NOT a manual configuration form. Forms are the power-user fallback for the 5% who already know what they want. The first-class experience is *"tell the AI what you care about, the AI proposes options with reasoning, you approve."*

   **Applies to:** source selection, action template choice, voice tone tuning, threshold setting, integration setup, model selection, framework picking, any onboarding step where a user might honestly say "I don't know what I need."

   **What this prevents:** the personal-pipeline mindset where you say "user adds X" and assume the user knows enough to find/configure X. ForgeMinds 2026-05-04: I instructed Victor to "click Add RSS Feed 10 times and paste these URLs" as Phase 1 close-out. He correctly called it out — real users have wildly varied interests/expertise/budgets and most don't know which RSS feeds exist for their domain. The fix isn't a better form; it's a conversational agent.

   **What this requires:**
   - A curated catalog (data layer) of options, with metadata rich enough for AI to match user intent (categories, subcategories, paywall status, quality scores, geographic relevance)
   - An LLM-backed agent (Claude Sonnet for conversation; cheaper models for sub-tasks) with RAG over the catalog
   - A power-user fallback ("Add custom URL") for the minority who DO know what they want — this fallback ships SECOND, not first
   - URL/endpoint validation to prevent hallucinated suggestions from polluting user data (use a `source-validator` subagent or equivalent)
   - Clear cost/effort transparency (paywall tier, time-to-first-value)

   **Tripwire:** any onboarding/config step that asks the user to enter a URL, API key, or technical config without first offering "want help picking?" requires a written justification in the spec OR a comment block in the route handler. If the spec says "user adds X" and X is a domain users may not know, the implementation MUST include both the conversational path AND the form fallback — not the form alone.

   See: ForgeMinds Phase 1.5 plan (sparkling-waddling-pinwheel.md "🔴 PIVOT 2026-05-04" section), `.claude/agents/source-catalog-curator.md`, `.claude/agents/source-validator.md`.

## XII. AI-at-the-Core (57) — added 2026-05-05 (Dorsey-thesis audit)

57. **AI-at-the-Core, Not AI-as-Bandage.** Every project has AI/LLM/automation/learning as the architectural CENTER, not a side panel, sidebar, or "powered by AI" badge. In 2026+, products where AI is a side feature get out-competed by products where AI is the core. Cursor outpaced VS-Code-with-Copilot because Cursor was AI-first; VS Code is an editor with AI bolted on. Replit Agent outpaced traditional IDEs for the same reason. The pattern is universal: in any category where AI can produce real decisions/actions/outputs, the AI-at-the-center contender wins because the bandage version can't keep up with the speed of underlying model improvements.

   **Mechanical test:** if you removed every AI/LLM call from the app, what percentage would still work?
   - **≥75% still works** → AI is a bandage. The product is a competitor's lunch. Redesign before V1 ships.
   - **50-74% still works** → AI is a feature, not the core. Justify in writing or expand the AI surface.
   - **≤50% still works** → AI is at the core. Proceed.

   **Required for any project to claim "AI-first":**

   (a) **Core data flow** includes ≥1 AI inference step that produces non-trivial decisions, actions, or outputs (not just "AI-suggested tags" on top of a manual flow).

   (b) **AI takes action / makes recommendations** on the user's behalf. User reviews + approves; user does NOT author from scratch with AI in a sidebar. The default mode is "the AI did the work, you check it," not "you do the work, AI helps a little."

   (c) **Per-user learning loop.** The product gets smarter for THIS user over time:
       - Voice DNA (user edits drafts → diffs train next-draft)
       - Save / dismiss / accept patterns drive future suggestions
       - Outcome ratings tune which recommendations appear
       - Prompt versions logged in audit trail per output (lessons.md #73)
       Static "we use AI" without a learning loop fails this rule.

   (d) **Conversational/intent-driven UI** where user might say "I don't know what I need" (see VIBE Rule 56). Forms are power-user fallbacks.

   (e) **Architecture admits AI failure modes:**
       - Hallucination prevention (4-layer pattern: real data → templates → profile match → AI synthesis with fact-check)
       - Data Maturity Gate before AI sees data (lessons.md #68, #74)
       - prompt_version logged in every AI-generated row
       - User feedback loops (thumbs up/down, edit-tracking)
       - Model swap-ability (provider abstraction at the router layer, not direct SDK calls)

   **Anti-patterns that violate this rule:**
   - Standalone CRUD app with one "Ask AI" sidebar
   - "AI-powered" marketing copy but every flow is a manual form
   - AI used only for marketing-content generation, not in the product's core loop
   - A hardcoded rules engine that could trivially replace the AI calls
   - "AI" features that are deterministic regex / keyword matches dressed up as ML

   **Tripwire:** any project's V1 spec where stripping out the AI integrations would leave ≥75% of the app functional requires either (a) a written architectural justification documented in `DECISIONS.md` OR (b) a redesign before V1 ships. Audit this at project scaffold AND at every phase close.

   **Audit cadence:** every phase close (after AUDIT GATE block) runs the AI-at-Core check as a manual question at the end of the audit:
   > "If I removed every AI call from this phase's deliverables, what % would still work?"
   Answer + percentage logged in the phase audit file.

   See: 2026-05-05 portfolio audit (FinKeel ✅, ForgeMinds ✅, HuntHive ✅, ForgeDesk ✅, EaseAway ⚠️ partial, BookDrop 🔴 pivot needed). Also: lessons.md #99 (the failure mode this rule prevents).

## XIII. Karpathy/Chang behavioral rules (58-60) — added 2026-05-24 (validated across 30 codebases over 6 weeks per Chang's repo + factory experience)

58. **🆕 Hard token budgets — not advisory.** *(Karpathy 12-rule Rule 6, factory-adopted 2026-05-24 after observing the same failure mode in long debugging sessions.)* Per-task budget: 4,000 tokens. Per-session budget: 30,000 tokens. If a task is approaching budget, summarize state and start fresh. **Surface the breach, do not silently overrun.** Real failure mode: 90-minute debugging session burning ~50k tokens iterating on the same error message, gradually losing track of fixes already tried. Without budgets, agents spiral. **Tripwire:** 45+ messages deep on the same bug with no progress = budget signal. Stop and write a one-page recap before another attempt. Applies to: in-session debugging loops, repeated failed verify gates, multi-file refactors that keep finding more affected files.

59. **🆕 Surface conflicts, don't average them.** *(Karpathy 12-rule Rule 7, factory-adopted 2026-05-24.)* If two existing patterns in the codebase contradict, **pick one** (more recent / more tested), **explain why**, and **flag the other for cleanup**. "Average" code that satisfies both contradicting patterns is the worst code. Real failure mode: codebase with both async/await + try/catch and a global error boundary — agent wrote new code doing BOTH, doubled error handlers swallowed errors twice. **Tripwire:** when reviewing a PR that touches an area with existing patterns, the PR description must name the pattern being followed. If two contradict, the PR description must say which one was chosen and why.

60. **🆕 Read before you write.** *(Karpathy 12-rule Rule 8, factory-adopted 2026-05-24.)* Before adding code in a file, read the file's exports, the immediate caller, and any obvious shared utilities. If you don't understand why existing code is structured the way it is, ask before adding to it. **"Looks orthogonal to me" is the most dangerous phrase in this codebase.** Real failure mode: agent adds a function next to an existing identical function it hadn't read; both do the same thing; the new one takes precedence because of import order; the old one had been the source of truth for 6 months. **Tripwire:** when adding new code to a file with ≥3 existing functions or utilities, the agent must first state what those functions do and why the new code doesn't duplicate them. If you can't state this, you haven't read enough.

**Reconciliation with existing rules:**
- These three are additive to Karpathy's original 4 (which are already covered by VIBE Rules 1-43: VIBE 1 Atomic Tasks ≈ Karpathy Think Before Coding; VIBE 17 Do Not Overbuild ≈ Karpathy Simplicity First; VIBE 19 Scope Lock ≈ Karpathy Surgical Changes; VIBE 4 Verification Required ≈ Karpathy Goal-Driven).
- Rule 10 (Karpathy "checkpoint after every significant step") is already factory CLAUDE.md §4 Rule 23 (project-level promotion to Rule 23 in May 2026 after the ForgeMinds Phase 0 audit failure).
- Rule 11 (Karpathy "match the codebase's conventions") is already VIBE Rule 6 Consistency Over Creativity.
- Rule 12 (Karpathy "fail loud") is already VIBE Rule 52 No Silent Catch Blocks.
- Rules 5 and 9 from Karpathy's set were skipped: Rule 5 ("model only for judgment calls") is too domain-specific for VictorForge multi-stack rule set; Rule 9 ("tests verify intent") is already implicit in Definition of Done.

Per lessons.md #88: the addition of 3 more rules pushes us to 60 total. Chang's data shows compliance starts dropping past 14 rules; VIBE rules are categorical (different sections govern different concerns), so the 60-rule corpus reads as ~8-12 active at any task. Audit if compliance becomes spotty.

## Definition of Done
- Zero build errors/warnings, zero console errors
- UI clean and consistent with design system
- Feature works as expected in browser
- Data persists to DB (verified with SELECT query)
- Data reads back correctly (correct types, amounts, IDs)
- Learning files updated (errors-fixed.json, golden-paths.md, CURRENT_SPRINT.md)
- One commit per task with descriptive message

**For smart features (projections, AI advice, reports, tax, financial calculations) — also:**
- [ ] All 4 DMG levels implemented (Ghost / Cold / Warm / Mature) — see data-integrity.md
- [ ] Manual entry capped at Level 2. Verified source required for Level 3.
- [ ] Speculative Mode watermark visible on every number, not just header
- [ ] Zero-data state tested — Ghost state shows, not broken or empty UI
- [ ] Account delete resets all maturity scores to 0
- [ ] Export disabled below Level 3 (no downloads of speculative projections)
- [ ] Dedup mechanism exists for every data-creating action (import_hash with UNIQUE constraint, idempotency key, or content fingerprint)
- [ ] Export history table exists — user can see what they exported and when
- [ ] AI audit trail includes `prompt_version` for every AI-generated insight
- [ ] DMG gate checked server-side BEFORE data reaches AI model — not just at the UI layer
