# Data Integrity & Maturity Gating (DMG)
The enforcement layer for every smart feature. Intelligence is a privilege earned through data density.
No feature may render confident numbers without passing the DMG threshold for its feature area.

## The 4-Level Data Maturity Gate

Every smart feature implements exactly these four states — no exceptions.

| Level | Name | Trigger | UI Behavior |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | Ghost | 0 data points | Feature hidden entirely, or shows intro card with "Upload to Start" CTA |
| 1 | Cold | < 50% required data | Amber banner + Data Hunt checklist + "Upload Missing" button |
| 2 | Warm | ≥ 70% required data | Speculative Mode: blurred or range numbers, "Low Confidence" badge |
| 3 | Mature | 100% required data, verified sources | Full smart feature, precise numbers, "Verified Data" badge |

**The rule:** Design all four states BEFORE writing happy-path code. The locked state is not an afterthought.

---

## Source Weight Hierarchy

Not all data is equal. Source quality determines maximum reachable maturity level.

| Source | Weight | Max Level Achievable |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Plaid bank sync (cryptographically signed) | Highest | Level 3 (Mature) |
| Gemini-verified OCR document | High | Level 3 (Mature) |
| Manual user entry | Low | Level 2 (Warm) max — NEVER unlocks Level 3 |
| Extrapolated/estimated data | None | Level 1 (Cold) only |

**Why:** Manual entry has no audit trail. A manually entered paystub amount could be wrong by $10,000. Projections based on it would be confidently wrong. Manual data shows a "Speculative Mode" watermark permanently.

---

## Speculative Mode (Warm unlock with watermark)

Users may choose to see Level 2 (Warm) projections before reaching Level 3. This is allowed, but only with a permanent visible watermark:

```
⚠️ SPECULATIVE MODE — Based on unverified or incomplete data.
   These numbers are estimates only. Do not use for tax filing.
```

**Rules:**
- Watermark must be visible on every number in Speculative Mode — not just a banner at the top
- Numbers shown as ranges, not precise figures: "$42,000 – $51,000" not "$46,500"
- Export is disabled in Speculative Mode. No downloads of unverified projections.
- There is no "Force Unlock Level 3." Mature status requires real data. Period.

---

## Stale Data Auto-Revert

Maturity is not permanent. Recurring data points that go missing degrade the feature.

**Rule:** If an expected recurring data point (monthly paystub, weekly transaction sync, quarterly statement) is missing for more than 35 days, the feature automatically reverts from Mature → Warm.

**Implementation:** A scheduled job (daily) checks last_received_at for each recurring data type per user. If gap > 35 days, set maturity_score to Warm for that feature area. Show banner: "Your data may be out of date. Upload your latest paystub to restore full accuracy."

---

## Per-Feature Maturity (Independent Gates)

Each feature area has its own independent maturity score. Missing a tax document does not break budget features.

| Feature Area | Key: profiles table | Required Data |
|---|---|---|
| Tax Projection | `tax_maturity` | W-2, paystubs (≥2), transactions, filing status, state |
| Budget Analysis | `budget_maturity` | 3+ months of transactions, income source |
| Cash Flow | `cashflow_maturity` | 60+ days of linked accounts or bank statements |
| Business Margin | `margin_maturity` | Revenue records, expense categories, time period |

**Architectural pattern — cache in profiles table:**
```sql
-- Add to profiles table migration
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN tax_maturity INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (tax_maturity BETWEEN 0 AND 3);
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN budget_maturity INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (budget_maturity BETWEEN 0 AND 3);
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN cashflow_maturity INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (cashflow_maturity BETWEEN 0 AND 3);
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN margin_maturity INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (margin_maturity BETWEEN 0 AND 3);
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN maturity_updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW();

-- Update via DB trigger on document upload (not on every page load)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_maturity_score()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Recalculate maturity for the affected feature area
  -- Call the appropriate scoring function based on NEW.document_type
  PERFORM recalculate_tax_maturity(NEW.user_id);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER on_document_uploaded
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON documents
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_maturity_score();
```

**Why trigger not page load:** Running completeness checks on every page load adds 50-200ms per view and adds DB load. Caching the score and updating it only when documents change keeps the UI instantaneous.

---

## Proximity Check (Temporal Integrity Enforcement)

Before accepting any financial document, verify it belongs to the current or selected fiscal period.

```typescript
function validateDocumentPeriod(doc: Document, selectedYear: number): ValidationResult {
  const docYear = extractTaxYear(doc); // from W-2 box, paystub date, statement header
  if (docYear !== selectedYear) {
    return {
      valid: false,
      warning: `This document is from ${docYear}. You're viewing ${selectedYear}.
                Do you want to add it to your ${docYear} records instead?`,
      suggestedYear: docYear
    };
  }
  return { valid: true };
}
```

Never silently accept a document into the wrong year. Always ask, never assume.

## AI Input Gate (server-side DMG enforcement)

The DMG doesn't just gate the UI — it gates what the AI model is allowed to see.

**Rule:** Before ANY data is sent to an AI model (Ollama, Gemini, Claude, any LLM), the calling function MUST check the feature's maturity level. If maturity < the feature's minimum threshold, the AI call is blocked — not degraded, not warned, BLOCKED.

**Why:** An LLM will generate confident-sounding insights from 3 transactions. It has no concept of "I don't have enough data." Your code is the only thing preventing wrong answers from being generated in the first place. Gating at the UI means the wrong answer already exists in memory. Gating at the function means it was never created.

**Pattern:**
```typescript
async function generateInsight(userId: string, featureArea: string) {
  const maturity = await getMaturityLevel(userId, featureArea);
  if (maturity < MINIMUM_FOR_INSIGHT) {
    return { blocked: true, reason: `Need maturity level ${MINIMUM_FOR_INSIGHT}, currently ${maturity}` };
  }
  // ONLY NOW send data to AI model
  const data = await fetchVerifiedData(userId, featureArea);
  return await callAIModel(data);
}
```

**Audit requirement:** Every AI call must log: `{ userId, featureArea, maturityLevel, promptVersion, modelName, timestamp }`. The `promptVersion` field tracks which version of the prompt template generated the result — so 6 months from now, when a user asks "why did the app say this?", you can trace it back to the exact prompt that produced it.

---

## Data Basis Disclosure (mandatory on every smart number)

Every projected or calculated number must show its source basis inline or via tooltip.

```
Annual Income Projection: $87,400
Based on: 8 of ~24 expected paystubs (Warm — 33% complete)
Source: Gemini-verified PDFs
Last updated: April 3, 2026
```

If data basis cannot be shown, the number should not be shown.

## Integrity-First Definition of Done

Add these checks to every smart feature task before marking DONE:

- [ ] **Data-Gate Implemented:** Feature handles all 4 DMG levels (Ghost/Cold/Warm/Mature)
- [ ] **Source Weight Enforced:** Manual entry capped at Level 2. Verified sources required for Level 3.
- [ ] **Speculative Mode Watermark:** Visible on every number when in Warm mode, not just header banner
- [ ] **Stale Data Trigger Written:** Recurring data staleness check exists (35-day rule)
- [ ] **Maturity Cached in DB:** profiles table has the maturity column, trigger updates it on doc upload
- [ ] **Per-Feature Independence:** This feature's gate does not affect other feature areas
- [ ] **Proximity Check:** Document year validation fires before accepting any financial document
- [ ] **Zero-Data State Verified:** Tested with no uploads — feature shows Ghost state, not broken UI
- [ ] **Account Delete Test:** Deleting user data resets all maturity scores to 0
- [ ] **Export Disabled in Speculative Mode:** No downloads allowed below Level 3
- [ ] **AI Input Gate:** AI model calls blocked server-side when maturity < threshold (not just UI-gated)
- [ ] **Prompt Version Logged:** Every AI-generated output stored with `prompt_version` for future traceability
- [ ] **Dedup Hash on Import Tables:** Every table accepting uploads/imports has `content_hash` UNIQUE column
- [ ] **Export History Exists:** User can see what they exported and when (table, not just a download button)

## When to Apply This Rule

Apply to every feature that produces a number, insight, projection, advice, or report that a user might act on:

- Tax projections, tax liability, estimated refunds
- Income projections, cash flow forecasts
- Margin signals, revenue trends, budget analysis
- AI financial advice, spending insights, category summaries
- Any "smart" recommendation or alert

Do NOT apply to: pure data lists (transaction history), raw document storage, settings pages, navigation.
